### **Additional Tips**
- **Practice Regularly**: SQL is best learned by practice. Try solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo.
- **Study Examples**: Look at real-world examples of database structures to understand how large-scale applications design their databases.
- **Ask Questions**: If you're stuck, refer to documentation or community forums like StackOverflow.
- **Keep Reviewing**: SQL is vast, and regular review will help consolidate your learning.
This roadmap will provide a structured way to master SQL in 30 days. By the end, you'll be equipped with the skills to handle a wide variety of SQL tasks.
